Projects from Python specialization hosted by University of Michigan.

# Python specialization (by University of Michigan)

This Specialization will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

# 1 - Introduction to Python
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Introduction
- Installing Python
- Using Python
- Variables and Expressions
- Conditional Code
- Functions
- Loops and Iteration

# 2 - Python Data Structures
This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course covers Python 3.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Strings
- Files
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples

# 3 - Python to Access Web Data
This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This course covers Python 3.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Regular Expressions
- Networks and Sockets
- Web Scraping
- Web Services and XML
- JSON and the REST Architecture

# 4 - Databases with Python
This course will introduce students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort.  The course will use SQLite3 as its database.  We will also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes.  We will use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. This course covers Python 3.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Object Oriented Python
- SQL basics
- Data Models and Relational SQL
- Many-to-Many Ralationships in SQL
- Databases and Visualization

# 5 - Python: Final Project
In the capstone, students will build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python.   The projects will involve all the elements of the specialization.  In the first part of the capstone, students will do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then will pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find. This course covers Python 3.

<b>Main topics:</b>
- Introduction to Final Project
- Building a Search Engine
- Exploring Data Sources
- Spidering and Modeling Email Data
- Accessing New Data Sources
- Visualizing Email Data
- Visualizing New Data Sources
